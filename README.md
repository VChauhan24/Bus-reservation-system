# 🚌 Bus Reservation System (SQL Project)

This is a simple Bus Reservation System built using SQL. It demonstrates basic database concepts like table creation, relationships, and SQL queries. Created as part of my B.Tech coursework to strengthen SQL skills.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `schema.sql` – Contains the SQL code to create tables
- `sample_data.sql` – Adds sample buses and bookings
- `queries.sql` – Contains useful queries like available seats, new bookings, cancellations, etc.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
- Relational database concepts
- Joins, aggregations, subqueries

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open your SQL client (like pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or DBeaver)
2. Run the `schema.sql` file to create the database tables
3. Insert the sample data using `sample_data.sql`
4. Try running different queries from `queries.sql`

## 💡 Features
